# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._

# Illustrating setup
_This section is only there to show how to insert results from other places in the project and how to cite figures and other references. Delete this whole section at some point._


This paper [@Leek2015a] discusses types of analyses. 


Figure \@ref(fig:resultfigure) shows a result figure from the analysis.

```{r resultfigure,  fig.cap='Analysis figure.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/resultfigure.png")
```

Table \@ref(tab:resulttable) shows a result table from the analysis.

```{r resulttable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/resulttable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Result Table.')
```


Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.


# Introduction (required for part 1)

## General Background Information
_Dengue is a disease caused by a family of viruses transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species (Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus) mosquito. Symptoms of Dengue fever include severe joint and muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, headache, fever, exhaustion, and rash. The presence of fever, rash, and headache (the "Dengue Triad") is characteristic of dengue fever. Each year, up to 400 million people get infected with Dengue. Approximately 100 million people get sick from infection, and 22,000 die from severe Dengue. Dengue is caused by one of any of four related viruses: Dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4.  For this reason, a person can be infected with a Dengue virus as many as four times within their lifetime. Dengue virus is prevalent throughout the tropics and subtropics; being common in over 100 countries in the world. Forty percent of the worldâ€™s population, about 3 billion people, live in areas with a risk of Dengue. Because of this, Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas with risk._


## Description of data and data source
_The following data is a collective of samples of weekly notified Dengue cases and climate variables in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka between the years of 2008 to 2014. Within the data frame there are 279 rows and 12 variables. During the sample time, the 12 tested variables were: Total number of notified Dengue cases (Cases), Year (Year), Week number to locate the week within a year (Week), Average temperature of the week (TEM), maximum temperature of the week (TMAX), Minimum temperature of the week (Tm), Sea level pressure (SLP), Relative humidity (H), Precipitation amount (PP), Mean visibility (VV), Mean wind speed (V), and Maximum sustained wind speed (VM)._

_The data was provided by Thiyanga Talagala, and published in 2018, taken from the weekly epidemiological reports published by the Epidemiological Unit, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. You can find the link to the data [here](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colmozzie)._



## Questions/Hypotheses to be Addressed
1 - Which variables are the best indicators for Dengue?
2- Can the indicators for Dengue be applied to similar ecosystems across the world devoid of Dengue if the vector was introduced to that area to provide an example as to how many cases of Dengue in those areas we would see?
3 - Does Maximum Sustained Wind Speed play a role in lower Dengue cases?
4 - How does Sea Level Pressure affect Dengue and its Vector?
5 - Does the Vector prefer warmer or cooler temperatures in tropical/subtropical zones when spreading Dengue?
6 - Does Precipitation attribute to higher Dengue cases?




# Methods and Results

_In most research papers, results and methods are separate. You can combine them here if you find it easier. You are also welcome to structure things such that those are separate sections._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._

## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what each file does. The files themselves should be commented well so everyone can follow along._

## Univariate analysis
_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. You should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for most of your variables. You definitely need to do it for the important variables, i.e. if you have main exposure or outcome variables, those need to be explored. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others._

## Bivariate analysis
_Create plots or tables and compute simple statistics (e.g. t-tests, simple regression model with 1 predictor, etc.) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable_


## Full analysis
_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You can then load the results produced by this code_

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_


_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_
