This is my Data Analysis Project examining data taken from a study on recorded Dengue cases in Sri Lanka.

You can look at how I previewed and cleaned the code in the Processing Script in the Code File. 

Figures can be found within the Analysis of the Code File, as well as the Results section. 


To Do List: 


- Create more plots and determine which ones work best for my work. 
- Improve quality of Graphs. 
- Write more explanations.
